# üîç VulnHunter Lab

**VulnHunter Lab** is an intentionally vulnerable web application and CI/CD security testbed designed to demonstrate, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities aligned with the **OWASP Top 10**. It integrates **DevSecOps pipelines**, secure coding, tool evaluation,
and security automation workflows.

---

## üìå Purpose

- Demonstrate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities through vulnerable-by-design routes
- Train developers on secure coding and vulnerability remediation
- Evaluate and integrate SAST, DAST, SCA, IaC, and secrets scanning tools
- Enable AppSec teams to test and tune security scanners in CI/CD pipelines
- Provide metrics and dashboards for security posture and maturity tracking

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Security Tools**:
  - **SAST**: Semgrep
  - **DAST**: OWASP ZAP (headless)
  - **SCA**: Trivy (for OS and Python deps)
